This repository contains files for different stack implementations like push, pop, and listing all stack elements.

#arrayIsFull.c
this file contains codes to check if the stack is full, to avoid stack overflow

#arrayIsEmpty.c 
this file contains codes to check if the stack is empty, to avoid stack underflow

#arrayPush.c

#arrayPop.c

#mainArray.c
